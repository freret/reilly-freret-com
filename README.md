# A personal website

This is a somewhat permanent place to keep the stuff I do. Also an experiment with [Inferno](https://www.infernojs.org/). Currently hosted @ [reillyfreret.com](https://www.reillyfreret.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app)
